I have completed the REST Server application using .NET Core Web API project. You can find the repository in below location.

Note: I did not managed to complete the simiulator application becuase of unable to spend more than 2 hours. The Idea is to create a Simulator Console project 
and add it to the same solution and run them at once. I thought of using HttpClient class for sending requests to the server.
